# RastaConverter Archive

* All images are created with [RastaConverter](https://github.com/ilmenit/RastaConverter).
* Screenshots are generated with [atari800](https://github.com/atari800/atari800).
* The default palette is PAL. If a filename contains the letters NTSC (case ignored) the NTSC palette is used.
* All images are sorted by their respective author. If a file is not labelled, it is sorted alphabetically in the '''various''' directory.
* To contribute to this archive, fork, and send a pull request.
* Alternatively, you can post to this [AtariAge thread](https://forums.atariage.com/topic/200118-images-generated-by-rastaconverter/) and it will eventually show up here.
* If you want to add authors or NTSC labels to existing files, fork, and send a pull request, or open an issue.
* To download the full archive, clone the repository or click on the green button that says Code and select download ZIP.
* The original RastaConverter does not compile cleanly on Linux. A fork with fixes is [here](https://github.com/ivop/RastaConverter).
